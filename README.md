Welcome to my portfolio site. It is currently a work in progress as I am teaching myself Typescript to create this.

##### This was created using Vite
You can use the Node Package manger to try it yourself,
***
``` $ npm create vite@latest ```
***
It is very simple to figure out, and the full documentation is available at ***
