      I used the

      created by
      <a href="http://socialprogress.org/" target="_blank"> Social Progress Imperative </a>

      <h3>Choropleth map and tooltip using React, D3, and lots of JavaScript</h3>
      <p className="grey-text">I was inspired by
        <a href="https://shirleywu.studio/filmflowers/" target="_blank"> Shirley Wu's Film Flowers </a>
        where she uses IMDB ratings and D3 to create a flower petal concept.
        Taking that a step further, I created a dynamic tooltip and choropleth map.
        Each of the tooltip's petal size is scaled accurately, and its corresponding subcategories bloom to represent the data.

      <p className="grey-text">Using artwork created by
        <a href="https://www.gingeryartistry.com/" target="_blank"> Jannah Minnix, </a>
        I created a react stamp book to engage users. There is also a physical stamp book to accompany this project.
